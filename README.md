ðŸš— Object Tracking and Counting using YOLO and OpenCV
ðŸ“˜ Description

This project implements a real-time object tracking and counting system using YOLO and OpenCV. It detects and tracks multiple objects in a video feed and counts them as they cross a predefined horizontal line. Each detected object is assigned a unique tracking ID, ensuring accurate counting without duplication. The results, including bounding boxes, class labels, IDs, and live counts, are displayed on the video frames.
This implementation is optimized for Google Colab, using cv2_imshow for frame visualization.
